# simpleServer
the web server should accepts
and parses an HTTP request, get the requested file from the server’s file system, then creates an HTTP response
message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines, and then send the response directly to
the client. If the requested file is not present in the server, the server sends an HTTP “404 Not
Found” message back to the client.
